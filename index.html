            The last meeting

        <p>Every moment I spent with you
            Was like a beautiful dream come true
            It was the best dream I ever saw
            More colorful than a rainbow
            Your pretty voice is echoing in my ear
            The splendid sound I ever hear
            No Nightingaleâ€™s song
            Can compare to your glamorous tone
            Those alighting brown eyes
            As bright as twinkling stars in the sky</p>
